- **Country name**
- **Year**
- **Life Ladder** (a measure of subjective well-being)
- **Log GDP per capita** (economic output per person)
- **Social support** (individual support from the community)
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (average number of years a person can expect to live in good health)
- **Freedom to make life choices** (the degree of autonomy individuals have)
- **Generosity** (the degree to which individuals give to others)
- **Perceptions of corruption** (public opinion on corruption levels)
- **Positive affect** (the prevalence of positive emotions)
- **Negative affect** (the prevalence of negative emotions)
- **Country name_encoded** (a unique identifier for countries)

### Data Characteristics

- **Data Range**: 2005 - 2023
- **Missing Values**: None
- **Descriptive Statistics**: The dataset's mean scores across indicators, such as a Life Ladder average of 5.48 and Healthy life expectancy reaching 63.45 years, provide a quantitative foundation for deeper insights.

## Analysis Conducted

1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Calculation of mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and other statistical measures to summarize key variables and identify trends over the various years.
   
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Her examination of relationships among variables was performed to discover which factors are most closely associated with happiness as measured by the Life Ladder score.

3. **Mutual Information Calculation**: This method revealed the dependencies between variables, illuminating how certain predictors influence the Life Ladder.

## Key Insights

1. **Correlation Strengths**:
   - A strong positive correlation exists between the **Life Ladder** score and:
     - **Log GDP per capita** (0.77): Economic prosperity significantly influences happiness.
     - **Social support** (0.72): Community support dovetails with improved well-being.
     - **Healthy life expectancy** (0.71): Better health outcomes lead to higher happiness levels.
   - In contrast, there is a notable negative correlation between **Perceptions of corruption** and **Life Ladder** (-0.42), highlighting that countries perceived as more corrupt see lower levels of happiness.

2. **Positive vs. Negative Affect**:
   - Positive emotions positively correlate with happiness (0.51), while negative emotions exhibit an inverse relationship (-0.35), reinforcing the importance of emotional wellbeing in overall life satisfaction.

3. **Generosity's Role**:
   - Although generosity shows a modest correlation with the Life Ladder (0.17), its lower influence suggests that while it plays a part, economic and social factors hold greater sway over happiness.

## Implications of Findings

1. **Policy Development**: Policymakers should prioritize economic growth, promote social initiatives focusing on community support, and improve health services to boost overall happiness.

2. **Strengthening Social Networks**: Emphasis should be placed on fostering social bonds and community support structures as integral components of happiness.

3. **Combating Corruption**: Reducing perceived corruption should be a strategic priority, contributing to both economic performance and public satisfaction.

4. **Mental Health and Emotional Support**: Promoting mental well-being initiatives aimed at increasing positive affect and reducing negative affect can lead to measurable improvements in happiness levels.

### Conclusion

The synthesis of our findings indicates a clear pathway for enhancing human happiness on a global scale. By intertwining economic, social, and emotional strategies, governments and organizations can work towards a holistic approach that enriches the individual's quality of life, fostering a more content global population.
