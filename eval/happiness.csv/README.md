## Overview

This document provides a detailed account of a comprehensive analysis conducted on a dataset consisting of global wellbeing indicators across countries. The dataset comprises 2,363 entries with critical metrics relevant to understanding the quality of life and overall happiness in various nations.

### Dataset Overview
- **Columns:**
  - Country name
  - Year
  - Life Ladder
  - Log GDP per capita
  - Social support
  - Healthy life expectancy at birth
  - Freedom to make life choices
  - Generosity
  - Perceptions of corruption
  - Positive affect
  - Negative affect
  - Country name encoded
- **Missing Values:** None detected in any of the columns, ensuring data integrity.
- **Range of Years:** From 2005 to 2023, allowing for a longitudinal study of changes over time.

## Analysis Conducted

The analysis involved several steps, including:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values across all variables.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluation of relationships between various indicators to identify patterns and associations.
3. **Skewness and Kurtosis**: Assessment of the distribution shapes of different metrics to understand their normality and variability.

## Key Insights Discovered

1. **Strong Relationships**:
    - The **Life Ladder** (a metric of subjective wellbeing) has a significant positive correlation with **Log GDP per capita** (0.77), **Social support** (0.72), and **Healthy life expectancy** (0.71). This suggests wealthier countries with strong community support structures and better health outcomes tend to report higher subjective wellbeing.
  
2. **Negative Influences**:
    - Higher **perceptions of corruption** correlate negatively with the **Life Ladder** (-0.42) and **Positive affect** (-0.27), implying that corruption diminishes overall happiness and feelings of positive wellbeing.

3. **Freedomâ€™s Role**:
    - The **freedom to make life choices** significantly correlates positively (0.54) with the **Life Ladder**. This underscores the importance of personal autonomy in fostering life satisfaction.

4. **Generosity in Context**:
    - Generosity showed weak correlation with the Life Ladder (0.17), indicating that while generosity is valued, its direct impact on wellbeing is less pronounced than other factors.

## Implications of Findings

The insights derived from this analysis have several implications, particularly for policymakers and stakeholders focusing on improving national wellbeing:

- **Focus on Economic and Social Policies**: Policymakers should prioritize strategies that boost economic performance and community support systems, as these are closely linked to improved wellbeing.
  
- **Combatting Corruption**: In tackling corruption and improving perceptions around it, governments may enhance national happiness and life satisfaction among citizens.

- **Enabling Freedom**: Creating environments that support individual freedoms can lead to increased life satisfaction. This highlights the need for policies promoting civil rights and personal freedoms.

- **Resource Allocation**: Resources may be more effectively allocated towards enhancing GDP and healthy life expectancy initiatives, alongside fostering social support mechanisms that contribute to overall happiness.
