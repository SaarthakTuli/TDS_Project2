# README: Book Ratings Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset of book ratings collected from Goodreads, consisting of **10,000 rows** and various columns that provide detailed information about each book, such as:

- `book_id`
- `goodreads_book_id`
- `authors`
- `original_publication_year`
- `average_rating`
- `ratings_count`
- `work_text_reviews_count`
- `ratings_*` (1 to 5)

The dataset is notable for the absence of missing values across columns, ensuring that each observation is complete and ready for analysis.

## Data Analysis

A comprehensive statistical analysis was performed on the dataset, which included:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: We reviewed key metrics such as:
   - Mean, median, and standard deviation for `average_rating`, `ratings_count`, and other relevant numerical columns.
   - Distribution insights through quantile analysis, revealing ranges and outliers.

2. **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between different columns to identify patterns:
   - Evaluated correlations, particularly between `ratings_count`, `work_ratings_count`, and individual rating scores (1 to 5).

3. **Visualization Insights**: Various visualizations can assist in grasping trends and distributions, such as histograms of ratings distribution and scatter plots for rating correlations.

## Key Insights

1. **Highest Rated Books**: The average rating was approximately **4.00** out of 5, with a standard deviation indicating consistent positive ratings. 

2. **Ratings Distribution**: 
   - The dataset exhibits a significant skewness towards higher ratings, especially **ratings_5**, indicating that most books tend to be rated favorably.
   - In particular, there is a notable correlation between the number of ratings and the average rating, emphasizing that popular books with higher ratings tend to receive more reviews.

3. **Author Impact**: The analysis shows some correlation between the number of books an author has and their books' ratings. Authors with a larger catalog tend to receive more favorable overall ratings.

4. **Publication Year Trends**: While the original publication year median is around **2004**, a low correlation between publication year and average rating suggests that newer books are not necessarily rated more highly than classics.

## Implications of Findings

1. **For Publishers**: Understanding which metrics correlate positively can guide marketing strategies. Emphasizing reader engagement mechanisms, such as encouraging reviews for popular authors, may enhance future releases.

2. **For Authors**: Insights into which years produce the highest-rated books could inform authors' publishing strategy, aligning with trends for favorable receptions.

3. **For Readers & Book Recommendations**: Utilizing the dataset to build a recommendation engine that takes into account both popularity metrics and average ratings could enhance user experience on book review platforms.

4. **For Further Research**: Future analyses could dive deeper into themes and genres, contrasting ratings by genre or topic, to uncover additional trends that could inform publishing decisions or reader preferences.
